# Platform Ui Recommended Extension Pack README

### Purpose of this Extension Pack

This curation of these packages was made to help UI development teams have a baseline of VS Code Extensions that promote commonalities in tools.

Every new developer to a team might bring their own flair of packages installed on their IDE, but many junior level developers may never customize their shell. These are just one person's opinion on a helpful set.

Enjoy!
